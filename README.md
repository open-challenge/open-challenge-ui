# Open challenge UI
this is an UI made with react and create-react-app

## Start project
```
yarn
yarn start
```

### `test`
```
yarn test
```

## Manual test
* Start [open challenge API](https://github.com/open-challenge/open-challenge-api).
* Create using postman an empty challenge
```
POST: /api/challanges
body:{}
```
* Use the editor id in the response
* start this project
* go to `/challenge/:id`

Anyway you can check the routes in the code so don't be lazy.
